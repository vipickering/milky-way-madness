<h1>Tasks and Activities</h1>
<p>Mapping soley the tasks grouped by activies (in a similar fashion to an activity map) across a Milky Way Map can aid in understanding what services are doing in the real world.</p>

<h2>When to use this mapping technique</h2>
<p>Milky Way Maps can be quite intimidating for non-technical people. Or those stakeholders who are not deep in to the details of a service (or services). </p>
<p>Starting with something simple, familiar and easy to grasp helps to anchor peoples minds on to concepts and better understand  what they are interpreting.</p>
<p>This approach is especially useful when using a user centred approach to desiging services : <p>
<p>(the) Activities  people do -> Require enterprise capabilities -> (that) Manifest themselves as functional actions -> (which) Require assets to be delivered. </p>
<p>Giving you the opportunitly to layer one concept at a time and use the value-chain as your common anchor between concepts</p>

<h2>When this approach is helpful</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dealing with stakeholders who want to broadly understand a service(s) or enterprise core activities</li>
    <li>Layering concepts for non-technical people</li>
    <li>Focusing on user-centred design aspects, journey mapping, usability and accessibility</li>
</ul>
