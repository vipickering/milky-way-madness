    <h1>Assets</h1>
    <p>Mapping soley the assets required, grouped by activies, across a Milky Way Map can aid in understanding what is required by your services.</p>
    <p>This view can help you understand if you you are using your resources effectively and if there are efficiencies to be gained by grouping or ustilising your assets in a more efficient or different manner. This can prompt questions and introduce ideas for combing services or deployment in a different manner and testing the outcomes to see if the consumers (or the operators) experience of the service is enhanced or encumbered.</p>
    <p>This approach is especially useful when using a user centred approach to desiging services : <p>
    <p>(the) Activities  people do -> Require enterprise capabilities -> (that) Manifest themselves as functional actions -> (which) Require assets to be delivered. </p>
    <p>Giving you the opportunitly to layer one concept at a time and use the value-chain as your common anchor between concepts</p>

    <h2>When to use this mapping technique</h2>
    <p>An asset view can be useful when management are concered that there is waste in the sytem or overspend that may need to be controlled. It can also be helpful to flip the system on its head and view it from another perspective to spot problems or issues that would remain invisible otherwise.</p>

    <h2>When this approach is helpful</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When management want to understand what is required from an Enterprise perspective to deliver services</li>
        <li>To get a handle on where expenditure could be occuring and why</li>
        <li>Exposing efficiencies to be gained that could otherwise be invisible or hard to see</li>
        <li>Better understanding a "cost to serve"</li>
        <li>Understanding maintenance and ongoing costs</li>
    </ul>
