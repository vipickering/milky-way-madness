    <h1>Barriers</h1>
    <p>Choices create barries as well as creating opportunity. </p>
    <p>Commonly choices are made without consideration given on the impact of the barrires formed , only the opportunity created. This can be made more complex if the consumer is required to use multiple services to get to their desired outcome, each with different barrires to negotiate.</p>
    <p>Have you considered "The cost to enter" your system or service?</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Is it required for a consumer to have access to a computer? </li>
        <li>Do they have to be able to speak a specific language?</li>
        <li>Are there acronyms or language unique to an undustry area?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Looking at the activities required can help you pose the question: "What other way(s) could a consumer perform this activity?"</p>
    <p>Looking at the assets required can help you pose the question: "What other way(s) could we deliver this service to consumers?"</p>
    <p>Looking at the functional implementation can help you pose the question: "How else could we deliver this service to consumers?"</p>
    <p>Looking at the capabilities required can help you pose the question: "What other ways can we deliver this service to consumers?"</p>

    <h2>When to use this mapping technique</h2>
    <p>If you are getting high levels of complaints, spotting paterns in customer interviews, or seeing a drop-off in a service usage it can be an indicator that choices made have created a barrier or series of barries that consumers cannot or do not wish to negotiate.</p>
    <p>Taking stock of the choices made to deliver the service, combined with journey mapping can help spot potential barriers and alternative approaches to resolving the problem(s).</p>

    <h2>When this approach is helpful</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Focusing purely on issues in delivering the service</li>
        <li>Understanding where (and which departments) in the Enterprise the issues lie, so that impact can be assesed and relevant stakeholders can be engaged to resolve it.</li>
        <li>Being proactive in spotting future issues and plans to resolve them should they become more prominent.</li>
    </ul>
